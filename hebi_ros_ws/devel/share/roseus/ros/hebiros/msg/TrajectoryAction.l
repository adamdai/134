MSG: sensor_msgs/JointState
# This is a message that holds data to describe the state of a set of torque controlled joints. 
#
# The state of each joint (revolute or prismatic) is defined by:
#  * the position of the joint (rad or m),
#  * the velocity of the joint (rad/s or m/s) and 
#  * the effort that is applied in the joint (Nm or N).
#
# Each joint is uniquely identified by its name
# The header specifies the time at which the joint states were recorded. All the joint states
# in one message have to be recorded at the same time.
#
# This message consists of a multiple arrays, one for each part of the joint state. 
# The goal is to make each of the fields optional. When e.g. your joints have no
# effort associated with them, you can leave the effort array empty. 
#
# All arrays in this message should have the same size, or be empty.
# This is the only way to uniquely associate the joint name with the correct
# states.
